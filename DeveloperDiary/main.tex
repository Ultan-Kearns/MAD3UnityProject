\section{What is this game?}

The game is a 2D platformer called quickfire.  The object of the game is 
to survive as many rounds as possible while bullets come flying at the player, the bullets will get faster with each level. At the beginning of the game the player will have a set number of lives and the object of the game is to avoid dying and to get a high score.
\section{Beginning the project}
I started this project off with brainstorming ideas of how to implement the various features that the designer had specified in the design document. I thought of how best to implement them so that the movement and gameplay would seem fluid and the controls intuitive. I also brainstormed what type of features could be improved upon and discussed these with the designer. I read the design document a few times to get the general feel for the game and to ensure I understood all the requirements for the game.  I began by making a simple prototype and slowly improving upon it gradually.  I discussed any changes I wished to make with the designer and ensured that they agreed with the changes before I began implementing them into the game.
\section{Starting to code}
When I started to code the project I had many issues such as boxcolliders not working and various other problems luckily these weren't  hard to solve as the unity documentation site here:\href{https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html}{Link to Unity documentation} is fairly extensive
